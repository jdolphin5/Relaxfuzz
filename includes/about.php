					<b>How to meditate with the videos</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					This website could be utilised for meditation in many different ways. If you are new to meditation or looking for some information on the topic, look no further!
					<br />
					<br />
					Here are a few simple steps to help guide you on your meditation journey:
					<br />
					<ol class="mainText">
						<li class="mainText1">
							Find a comfortable position to sit in
						</li>
						<li class="mainText1">
							Play one of our videos in full-screen mode, and keep your attention on the video. Try to pay attention to any sounds or images you notice
						</li>
						<li class="mainText1">
							Your mind will start to drift to other thoughts you have. Simply take note of these thoughts, and bring your attention back to the video
						</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
					<br />
					With some consistency, this practice will become much easier, and you will start to reap many of the benefits that meditation practice brings!
					<br />
					<br />
					Alternatively, you might prefer a mindful meditation practice. For this style, you should use a video just as a background/ambiance. And instead of focusing on the video, you should focus on your senses or your breath.
					<br />
